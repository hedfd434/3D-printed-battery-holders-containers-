# Custom Battery holder for 14500/AA battery type
Important note ⚠️❗: this repository is a part of Crius Space can-sat Team report.

## Content and purpose of this repository:
- this repository contains simple model (in .stl and .3fd extension) that is ready to print and shows our capabilities in terms of 3D design and integration with pre made parts like batteries.
- this model is made for 14500/AA battery type, allowing user to have 1.5V or 4.2V power supply, in the future we will use this model to develop fully function battery holder for our can-sat.

## what is in particular folders
- documentation - documentation of plates (basic dimensions).

- fusion360_models - models of the battery holder that you can freely customize.

- images - all of images taken during and post development.

- notes - nothing important.

- stl_models - print ready models in .stl format.
